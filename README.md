# Bioinspired Intelligence 
This is code written for the Bio-Inspired Intelligence course given at the TU Delft. The assignment consisted of developing an evolutionary robotics algorithm for a differential drive robot. The following code consists of an algorithm that generates a map and an algorithm that uses evolutionary principles to develop autonomous control behavior on a robot. 

##Code Overview
The 'main' file runs the complete program and plots the performance of the corresponding setting of the algorithm
